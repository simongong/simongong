<h2>Welcome Message</h2>
<br>
Hi, I'm GongZhenhua. Welcome to my Github homepage!
<br><br>
I've been focused on front-end development for years. Currently I'm leading the e-commerce UX engineering team at <a href="https://www.didiglobal.com/"> &nbsp; <img style="width:60px;" src="https://website.didiglobal.com/dist/media/logo-zh.a7abd90d.svg" alt="Didi Global" /></a>&nbsp;. Of all the projects that I worked on with Didi, my favorite one is the tools-store. It provides a self-defined component runtime and a developer-friendly toolkit, which greatly helps the refacotoring and maintenance of a many-years-old monolith system. 
<br>
Before Didi, I worked as a front-end engineer at <a href="https://chuangyi.taobao.com/"><img style="height:32px;" src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/O1CN01KcN0MM1UVZycMamYE_!!6000000002523-2-tps-234-80.png" alt="Alimama" /></a>, which helps sellers of taobao.com with online marketing and promotion. I helped build a platform, aiming fast building and high-perform rendering of promotion pages.
<br>
I worked at <img src="https://www.sony.com/en/template/2020/en/img/logo.svg" style="width:100px;background:#000;margin:0;padding:2px"></img> at Tokyo as a full-stack engineer after graduate from BUPT. We built a cloud-based web application <a target="_blank" src="https://playmemoriesonline.com">PlayMemories Online</a>, on which you can easily sync and manage you photos and videos taken by Sony devices. It has been an incredible learning experience with my brilliant colleagues. Starting my career at Sony makes me feel so lucky and I'll be forever gratefull for.
<br>
Throughout my career I’ve tried to build things that help facilitate people's daily life with excellent user experience. I’ve learned a lot and there is still so much more to do in this space.
<br>
And I'll share what I've learned these years by writing blog post here. I hope you can find something helpful or enlightening.
<br>
Learn. Share. Repeat.
